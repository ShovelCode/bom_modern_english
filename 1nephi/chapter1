(1) I am Nephi, my parents were decent, my father taught me much of whatever he knew. I saw a lot of suffering in my life, all while being favored by God, as such I have great 
knowledge of God's goodness and mysteries, and so I am writing down these events.
(2) I am writing this in the language of my father, a creole of the Jewish and Egyptian languages.
(3) I testify that this record is true, that I have made it, and that I am using all my knowledge to write it.
(4) In the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, (my father is named Lehi and has lived in Jerusalem all his life), that many prophets emerged
and testified that the people should repent or else Jerusalem would be destroyed.
(5) So my father Lehi prayed with effort on behalf of all of us.
